# Enhanced Survival Plugin
this plugin provides the server with an additional command - ```/quest_blaze``` - which spawns a custom entity with the look of a blaze that just stands still and looks at players

when right clicked an inventory is opened, which has selectable items that execute commands when clicked

currently it checks if the player has the wanted items in his inventory, and if yes it removes them and gives the player an additional heart
